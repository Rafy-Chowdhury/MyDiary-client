For deploying this project i have used firebase( for client ) and heroku( for server ). I have tried to include redux and redux-saga in this projects but i can't. The only problem i faced in redux that when i tried to run my code, browser throw an error like object(...) is not a function if i was given few more days i definitely could solve this problem.
